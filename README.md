# MonteCarlo-BlackScholes

Project that contains two programs to calculate european options price
1. One uses the closed form partial differential equation
2. The second uses the stochastic differential equation form and Monte Carlo simulation
    * Each run can be run sequentially or in parallel (using std::future) to improve performance
